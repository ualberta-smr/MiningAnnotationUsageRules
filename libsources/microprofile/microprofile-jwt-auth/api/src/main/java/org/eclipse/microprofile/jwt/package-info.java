/**
 * <p>
 * Interoperable JWT RBAC for Microprofile
 *
 * <h2>Overview</h2> This package contains the primary interfaces and support classes for the JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for
 * Role Based Access Control (RBAC) of MicroProfile microservice endpoints. The primary class is the JsonWebToken
 * interface that defines the view of the current authenticated user and associated JWT claims. It is available for
 * injection as well as the user principal available from the container security API.
 *
 * The supporting classes in this package include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Claim: a qualifier annotation used to mark a JWT claim value injection point</li>
 * <li>Claims: this is an enum that defines the names and types of the JWT claims standardized through RFC7519, OIDC,
 * etc.</li>
 * <li>ClaimValue: this is a proxyable/injectable interface that represents the value of a single JWT claim.</li>
 * </ul>
