== Release Notes for MicroProfile JWT 2.0

=== Incompatible Changes
This release aligns with Jakarta EE 9.1 (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-auth/issues/246[246]), so it won't work with earlier versions of Jakarta or Java EE.

=== API/SPI Changes
There are no functional changes introduced in this release, except the dependency updating from javax to jakarta.

=== Other Changes
- TCK Jose4j dependency has been bumped to 0.7.9 to support running TCK with Java 17 (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-auth/issues/251[251])
- TCK ApplicationScopedInjectionTest has been fixed (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-auth/pull/250[250])

- Support for verifying JWT tokens which have been signed using Elliptic Curve `ES256` signature algorithm (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-auth/issues/161[#161])
- Support for decrypting JWT tokens which have been encrypted using `RSA-OAEP` and `A256GCM` algorithms and contain the claims or inner-signed JWT tokens (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-auth/issues/58[#58])
- Support for JWT audience `aud` claim (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-auth/issues/121[#121])

- Support for RSA keys of 1024 bit length has been deprecated (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-auth/issues/197[#197])

=== Other Changes

- Update to Jakarta APIs for MP 4.0 (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-auth/pull/143[#143])

== Release Notes for MicroProfile JWT 1.1.1

=== Changes in 1.1.1-RC2

This candidate patch release provides one additional TCK test fix, and information on how to use the MP-JWT
configuration properties as environment variables on platforms that don't allow dots '.' in their names.

There are no API changes.

=== Closed Issues in 1.1.1-RC2
https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-auth/issues/104
https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-auth/issues/107

=== Changes in 1.1.1-RC1
This is a candidate patch release that provides fixes to the TCK tests that were seen to have issues in different implementations.
The TCK tests WARs now include a META-INF/MPJWTTESTVERSION resource that contains the major/minor version string enum for the MP-JWT version the test WAR is targeting. Currently the versions enums are:

```java
public enum MpJwtTestVersion {
    MPJWT_V_1_0,
    MPJWT_V_1_1
    ;
}
```

There are no API changes.

[[release_notes_11]]
== Release Notes for MicroProfile JWT 1.1

The focus of this release was to add support for configuring the public key and issuer needed for verification of the MP-JWT using MicroProfile Config. The new MicroProfile Config properties are:

mp.jwt.verify.publickey:: The embedded key material of the public key for the MP-JWT signer in PKCS8 PEM or JWK(S) format. If not found the mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location needs to be checked.
mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location:: The relative path or full URL of the public key. All relative paths will be resolved within the archive using ClassLoader.getResource. If the value is a URL it will be resolved using new URL(“...”).openStream()
mp.jwt.verify.issuer:: The expected iss claim value to validate against an MP-JWT.
