== GraphQL Entities

Entities are the objects used in GraphQL. They can be:

- <<scalars>>, or simple objects ("scalars" in GraphQL terminology), 
- <<enums>> (similar to Java Enum), 
- <<complexobjects>> that are composed of scalars and/or enums and/or other complex objects and/or collections of these.
