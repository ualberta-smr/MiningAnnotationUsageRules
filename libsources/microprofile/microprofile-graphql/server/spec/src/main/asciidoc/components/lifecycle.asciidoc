=== Lifecycle

MicroProfile GraphQL components (POJOs annotated with `@GraphQLApi`) are CDI beans. As such, their lifecycle is managed
by CDI. Request-scoped components should be constructed per-request, and application-scoped components should exist for
the lifetime of the application.  One exception to the normal scoping is `@Dependent` - this scope is treated as if it
were a singleton.
